\section{Available Attribute Values}{

\describe{
\item{<number.optional.number>}{The standard deviation for the blur operation. If two <number>s are provided, the first number represents a standard deviation value along the x.axis of the coordinate system established by attribute 'primitiveUnits' on the 'filter' element. The second value represents a standard deviation in Y. If one number is provided, then that value is used for both X and Y. A negative value is an error (see Error processing). A value of zero disables the effect of the given filter primitive (i.e., the result is the filter input image). If 'stdDeviation' is 0 in only one of X or Y, then the effect is that the blur is only applied in the direction that has a non.zero value. If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of 0 were specified.Animatable. yes.}
